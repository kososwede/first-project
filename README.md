# FIRST-PROJECT

This project was built for my student assignment, It is a website that allows visitors to Strängnäs to see how beautiful the town is and also what it has to offer.

## DEPLOYMENT

I deployed my website and files using GIT and GITHUB hosting. GIT is used to push files up to GITHUB where i can store the code for you to see. If you want to see the source code you click on the file name index.html or style.css.

## UX

#### USER STORIES
As a visitor to the Strängnäs I want to know about things to see and do locally and also the surrounding areas. I would like to see a map so that it would make it easier to navigate around and also links to the places/activities websites to gather more information or book tickets if needed.

Here is a link to my wireframes: https://balsamiq.cloud/skey8pl/pxfxgq6/r5B98?f=N4IgUiBcAMA0IDkpxAYWfAMhkAhHAsjgFo4DSUA2gLoC%2BQA%3D

I changed my final design of the website so that all the information would be the same on desktop and mobile so that users would not miss out on anything. So instead of taking the images and videos page off I decided to leave it on.
I also moved the Navbar to the top of the screen instead of in the middle on the landing page so that it would keep the same appearance throughout.

#### STRATEGY
This project was designed for visitors to Strängnäs. Visitors to the website should be able to seewhat Strängnäs has to offer, either if they are visiting for a day or taking a longer break.

#### SCOPE
There should be images to show how beautiful Strängnäs is, there should also be a map so that places of interest are easier to find. There will be links to social media and external websites if the customer feels that they need more information.
All images in the images & videos page will be made clickable so that they can be viewed on a full screen either on desktop or mobile. The navigation bar shall become a burger icon on mobile devices that will drop down the pages when pressed making it easier to navigate around the website on a mobile device. There shall be a sign up area in the footer so you can have special offers and discounts on anything in Strängnäs or around Södermanland.

#### STRUCTURE
The information is structured so that the relevant information is placed in their own pages:
* History
* Things to do
* Images & videos
* Map

The Navbar will be fixed to the top on all devices and screen sizes to keep it user friendly and easily accessable. The footer will be visible when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page so that more of the actual content is shown on the screen.
 
#### SKELETON
Full screen landing page features an image of Strängnäs in the summer and will want users want to see more. It will be kept full screen on all devices, all of the information will be available on desktop and mobile devices as I dont want anyone to miss out on the features my website has to offer.

#### SURFACE
I wanted to keep the website simple and clean
